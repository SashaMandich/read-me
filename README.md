# Read-Me Templates

This repository contains a collection of README files that serve as templates for new projects. Each template is an approved starting point designed for a specific project type. These templates include non-functional requirements and guidance on how to customize them for use with OpenAI Codex project creation.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to provide ready-to-use README files that help standardize documentation across projects. Each README in this repository:

- Represents a particular project category (for example, a Python package, a Node.js application, or a documentation site).
- Contains predefined sections and instructions for what information to include.
- Lists any non-functional requirements that apply to that project type.

By starting with these templates, teams can quickly generate consistent documentation and ensure important project details are not overlooked.
