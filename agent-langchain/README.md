# LangChain Configuration

## Purpose
A configuration template for [Project Name] built using **LangChain**. This guide outlines best practices for defining chains, prompts, and integrations. Replace `[Project Name]` with the name of your application.

## Features
- Modular chains that combine prompts, tools, and memory
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Cohere, etc.)
- Environment-based settings for API keys and endpoints
- Built-in callbacks for logging and tracing
- Example evaluations for prompt/response quality
- Guidelines for secure secret management

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Place configuration files under `configs/` in YAML or JSON format.
3. Set API keys in your `.env` file or secrets manager.
4. Load the configuration in your app and initialize LangChain components.
5. Run automated tests to validate chain behavior.

## Configuration Guidelines
- Clearly document each chain's role and its expected inputs/outputs.
- Keep prompts in separate files when they grow large.
- Parameterize secrets using environment variables.
- Include comments for complex tool or memory usage.
- Validate your configuration with unit tests and schema checks.

## Directory Structure
```
agent-langchain/
├── configs/        # LangChain configuration files
└── README.md       # This template
```

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Configuration files must be linted and validated before commit.
- Provide tests ensuring chains respond correctly given sample inputs.
- Run validation and unit tests in CI prior to merging changes.

## Global Standards

### Security Standards
- Never commit API keys or credentials into configuration files.
- Store secrets in environment variables or a secure secrets manager.
- Restrict read/write permissions on configuration files.

### Logging Specifications
- Enable callbacks for structured logging of chain execution.
- Aggregate logs centrally for debugging and analysis.

### Error Handling
- Provide fallback responses when LLM requests fail.
- Document retry logic for external API calls.

## Customization Notes
- Extend the features section with domain-specific chains or tools.
- Update the directory structure as your project evolves.
- Document how your application loads and runs these LangChain configs.
