# FastAPI Microservice

## Purpose
A FastAPI-based microservice for [Project Name]. This service exposes RESTful endpoints and can be combined with other microservices or a web frontend.
Replace `[Project Name]` with the name of your application throughout this file. Add or remove sections as the project structure becomes clear.

## Features
- Asynchronous Python runtime
- `uvicorn` development server
- Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Dependency injection using `Depends`
- Optional SQLAlchemy integration
- Environment-based settings with Pydantic `BaseSettings`
- Automatic OpenAPI docs available at `/docs`
- Health and readiness endpoints
- Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup
- Unit tests with `pytest`

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables (database URL, secrets, etc.).
3. Run the application with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
4. Execute the tests using `pytest`.
5. Lint and format the code with your preferred tools (`ruff`, `black`, etc.).

## API Endpoints
Document your API here once routes are defined.

| Method | Path    | Description    |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| GET    | /health | Liveness probe |
| GET    | /ready  | Readiness probe|

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Code must pass linting and formatting checks before commit.
- Provide unit tests for critical paths.
- Ensure container builds succeed under CI.
- Expose OpenAPI schema for integrations.

## Global Standards

### Security Standards
- Use `.env` files for secrets and never check them into source control.
- Recommend dependency scanning (`pip-audit`).
- Implement authentication and authorization if required.
- Enforce HTTPS and secure headers when deployed.

### Logging Specifications
- Use structured JSON logging.
- Define log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).
- Provide centralized logging support (e.g., Fluentd, Loki, or the ELK stack).

### Error Handling
- Return a consistent error schema: `{"error_code": "...", "message": "...", "details": {...}}`.
- Provide sample responses for common failure scenarios.
- Include retry/backoff logic where appropriate.

## Customization Notes
- Update the API table with your actual endpoints.
- Expand the directory structure section as the project grows.
- Add deployment instructions (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) as needed.
